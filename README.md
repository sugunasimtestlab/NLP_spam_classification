#NLP Spam Classification

🚀 Detecting Spam with NLP & Machine Learning! 🔍

Did you know that 45% of all emails are spam? 📩 Identifying spam is a real challenge in cybersecurity, so I built an NLP-based Spam Classifier!

🔹 Tech Stack & Process:
✅ Cleaned & preprocessed text (stopwords removal, stemming)
✅ Used CountVectorizer for feature extraction
✅ Trained a Multinomial Naïve Bayes model for classification
✅ Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance
✅ Achieved high accuracy & F1-score in detecting spam! 🎯

📊 Key Takeaways:
✔ NLP techniques like stemming & tokenization improve classification
✔ Balancing data (using SMOTE) prevents biased models
✔ Choosing the right ML model makes a big difference!
