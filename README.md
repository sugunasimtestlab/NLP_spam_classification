# 📌 NLP Spam Classification using Machine Learning

## 🚀 Project Overview
This project focuses on **Spam Message Classification** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning techniques**. The goal is to build a model that can classify SMS messages as **spam** or **not spam (ham)**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **NLTK** (Natural Language Processing Toolkit)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Handling)
- **SMOTE (Imbalanced Data Handling)**

## 📌 Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Remove stopwords, punctuations, and apply stemming  
   - Convert text into numerical features using **CountVectorizer**  
2. **Data Balancing**  
   - Applied **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**  
3. **Model Training**  
   - Used **Naïve Bayes Classifier** for classification  
4. **Evaluation**  
   - Achieved high accuracy with **classification report & confusion matrix**  

## 📊 Results
The model was successfully trained and tested, achieving high accuracy in spam detection.
